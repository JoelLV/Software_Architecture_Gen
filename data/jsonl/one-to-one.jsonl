Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern became popular for designing web applications. Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate the implementation of the pattern. The model is the central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application. The view handles any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The job of the controller is to simply accept input and convert it to commands for either the model or view. The MVC pattern is a suitable choice for this requirement because it separates the data model (course content), user interface (course listings and quizzes), and application logic (enrollment and progress tracking).</s>"}

This is achieved by the reduction of several dependencies in the code base, allowing developers to evolve their services with limited restrictions from users, and for additional complexity to be hidden from users.
