"Title: E-commerce Shopping Cart
Description: Develop a shopping cart feature that allows users to add, modify, and remove items before checkout.
Precondition: The software must be operational, and product data should be available.
Postcondition: Users can manage items in their shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
Sequence:
Users browse products and add them to the shopping cart.
Users can modify quantities or remove items from the cart.
Users proceed to the checkout process.","Software Architecture Pattern: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern became popular for designing web applications. Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate the implementation of the pattern. The model is the central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application. The view handles any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The job of the controller is to simply accept input and convert it to commands for either the model or view.
Explanation: The MVC pattern is suitable for this requirement because it neatly separates the data model (shopping cart), the user interface (view), and the application logic (controller). This separation allows for easy management of user interactions with the shopping cart, including adding, modifying, and removing items."
"Title: Real Estate Listings
Description: Build a real estate listing platform where users can browse and filter property listings.
Precondition: The software must be running, and property data should be available.
Postcondition: Users can search for and view real estate listings based on their preferences.
Sequence:
Users access the real estate listing platform.
Users apply filters and search criteria to find properties.
Property listings matching the criteria are displayed.","Software Architecture Pattern: Client-Server 
Explanation: The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web. The "client-server" characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services. Servers are classified by the services they provide. For example, a web server serves web pages, and a file server serves computer files. A shared resource may be any of the server computer's software and electronic components, from programs and data to processors and storage devices. The sharing of resources of a server constitutes a service.
Whether a computer is a client, a server, or both, is determined by the nature of the application that requires the service functions. For example, a single computer can run a web server and file server software at the same time to serve different data to clients making different kinds of requests. The client software can also communicate with server software within the same computer. Communication between servers, such as to synchronize data, is sometimes called inter-server or server-to-server communication.
Clients and servers exchange messages in a request-response messaging pattern. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of messages is an example of inter-process communication. To communicate, the computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. A server may receive requests from many distinct clients in a short period. A computer can only perform a limited number of tasks at any moment, and relies on a scheduling system to prioritize incoming requests from clients to accommodate them. To prevent abuse and maximize availability, the server software may limit the availability to clients. Denial of service attacks are designed to exploit a server's obligation to process requests by overloading it with excessive request rates. Encryption should be applied if sensitive information is to be communicated between the client and the server. The client-server pattern is suitable for this requirement as it involves users accessing a centralized platform (server) to search and retrieve real estate listings. The server manages the property data and responds to user queries, making it an effective choice for this scenario."
"Title: Inventory Tracking (Microservices)
Description: Develop a microservices-based system to track inventory levels, handle orders, and manage suppliers.

Postcondition: Inventory is tracked, orders are managed, and supplier interactions are facilitated.
Sequence:
Users place orders, triggering order processing microservices.
Inventory microservices update stock levels.
Supplier microservices manage supplier relationships.","Software Architecture Pattern: Microservices
Explanation: Microservices architecture is a variant of the service-oriented-architecture structural style. It is an architectural pattern that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services, communicating through lightweight protocols. One of its goals is that teams can develop and deploy their services independently of others. This is achieved by the reduction of several dependencies in the code base, allowing developers to evolve their services with limited restrictions from users, and for additional complexity to be hidden from users. As a consequence, organizations are able to develop software with fast growth and size, as well as use off-the-shelf services more easily. Communication requirements are reduced. These benefits come at a cost to maintaining the decoupling. Interfaces need to be designed carefully and treated as a public API. One technique that is used is having multiple interfaces on the same service, or multiple versions of the same service, so as to not disrupt existing users of the code. Microservices architecture is the ideal choice for this requirement because it involves a complex system with multiple distinct services (inventory tracking, order management, supplier interaction). Microservices provide flexibility and scalability, allowing each component to be independently developed, deployed, and scaled to meet the specific demands of its functionality."

Explanation: The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web. The "client-server" characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such services. Servers are classified by the services they provide. For example, a web server serves web pages, and a file server serves computer files. A shared resource may be any of the server computer's software and electronic components, from programs and data to processors and storage devices. The sharing of resources of a server constitutes a service.
Whether a computer is a client, a server, or both, is determined by the nature of the application that requires the service functions. For example, a single computer can run a web server and file server software at the same time to serve different data to clients making different kinds of requests. The client software can also communicate with server software within the same computer. Communication between servers, such as to synchronize data, is sometimes called inter-server or server-to-server communication.
Clients and servers exchange messages in a request-response messaging pattern. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response. This exchange of messages is an example of inter-process communication. To communicate, the computers must have a common language, and they must follow rules so that both the client and the server know what to expect. A server may receive requests from many distinct clients in a short period. A computer can only perform a limited number of tasks at any moment, and relies on a scheduling system to prioritize incoming requests from clients to accommodate them. To prevent abuse and maximize availability, the server software may limit the availability to clients. Denial of service attacks are designed to exploit a server's obligation to process requests by overloading it with excessive request rates. Encryption should be applied if sensitive information is to be communicated between the client and the server. The client-server pattern is suitable for this requirement as it involves users accessing a centralized platform (server) to buy and sell products. The server manages product listings, cart management, and order processing."

Explanation: Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern became popular for designing web applications. Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate the implementation of the pattern. The model is the central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application. The view handles any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The job of the controller is to simply accept input and convert it to commands for either the model or view. The MVC pattern is a suitable choice for this requirement because it separates the data model (tasks), user interface (task lists and progress tracking), and application logic (task creation and assignment)."

Explanation: Microservices architecture is a variant of the service-oriented-architecture structural style. It is an architectural pattern that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services, communicating through lightweight protocols. One of its goals is that teams can develop and deploy their services independently of others. This is achieved by the reduction of several dependencies in the code base, allowing developers to evolve their services with limited restrictions from users, and for additional complexity to be hidden from users. As a consequence, organizations are able to develop software with fast growth and size, as well as use off-the-shelf services more easily. Communication requirements are reduced. These benefits come at a cost to maintaining the decoupling. Interfaces need to be designed carefully and treated as a public API.
