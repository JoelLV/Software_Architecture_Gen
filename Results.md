**Expected Pattern:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:** Microservices

**Actual Output:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:** 1. Client-Server 2. Microservices 3. Event Driven

**Explanation:** A client-server architecture is well suited for this requirement because it allows multiple concurrent users to access and update data through centralized servers. This architecture provides scalability, allowing the system to handle large volumes of data and accommodate changes over time. Centralization of data and applications reduces latency and improves response times. Clients may reside on either side of the server, which allows businesses to choose a server location that best fits their needs. As a result, client-server architecture is the most appropriate choice for this requirement.
A microservices architecture is an ideal fit for this project as it involves the development of several interconnected services that can be independently deployed, scaled, and maintained. These services include inventory tracking, order processing, and supplier management. Each component should have its own database and application


## Test 3
**Input:**

Title: Employee Performance Management System'\n Description: Develop a system for assessing and managing employee performance, including goal setting, performance reviews, and skill development.\n Precondition: The software must be accessible to all employees and managers, ensuring data privacy and security. It should integrate with HR databases for up-to-date employee information.\n Postcondition: Managers can efficiently set and monitor employee goals, conduct performance reviews, and identify skill gaps, leading to improved employee development and organizational success.\n Sequence: Authorized users log in to the performance management system using secure credentials. They can then set performance goals, provide feedback, and track employee progress. The system should also generate reports for HR analytics and decision-making.\n Software Architecture Pattern: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)\n Explanation: A Service-Oriented Architecture is suitable for the Employee Performance Management System due to its ability to encapsulate business functionalities into independent services. Each aspect, such as goal setting, performance reviews, and skill development, can be treated as a separate service. This promotes reusability and maintainability, allowing for easier updates and enhancements to individual services without affecting the entire system. Additionally, SOA supports interoperability, enabling seamless integration with HR databases and other enterprise systems.\n

**Expected Output:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:** Microservices

**Actual Output:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:**  MVC (Model View Controller)

**Explanation:** Model is an object structure that contains variables and functions related to user preferences or content of the application. This includes any business logic that needs to be carried out when processing input from a view or controller. Views are interfaces of the model that are responsible for presenting information clearly. These may take various forms such as tables, graphs, charts, lists etc. depending on the information being presented. Controllers act as intermediaries between models and views. A variety of tasks can be performed by controllers, but it is primarily their responsibility to handle incoming data validation and authentication, as well as handling requests made by views. As stated previously, these interactions can either be through explicit programming or through convention. Convention refers to a technique in which the relationship between the model, view, and controller are not explicitly programmed. Instead, one uses language features included in a programming language to infer the relationships

**Expected Output:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:** 'Model-View-Controller (MVC)'

**Actual Output:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:** MVC (Model-View-Controller)

**Explanation:** MVC is an architectural pattern commonly used to design applications that separates the application logic (model), user interface (view), and application dispatch logic (controller). This separation provides many benefits including an increase in flexibility and reusability of each component, reduced complexity due to independence of the components, and uncomplicated transformation of the application as needed. In our case, the model would be our database table(s) which holds all the data we need to interact with. Our view(s) will consist of forms and tables that display data from the database and allow users to interact with it. Lastly, our controller(s) will handle any input from the user and send this information to the appropriate component. For example, if someone wanted to update a particular record they may use a form with text boxes allowing them to enter updated values for each field within the

**Expected Output:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:** 'Model-View-Controller (MVC)'\n 

**Actual Output:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:**  MVC (Model–view–controller)

**Explanation:** Model - Customer, Product, Order etc.
View - Dashboard, Reports etc.
Controller - Handle user interaction with application like search, filter, sort etc.
There are multiple benefits of using this architecture pattern, including separation of concerns, reusability, flexibility, and scalability. Separating the model (data), view (user interface), and controller (application logic) allows developers to efficiently manage each aspect of an application independently. This facilitates changes to one element without disrupting the others, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability. Reusing existing code reduces development time and effort while ensuring maintainability. Flexibility is achieved through the ability to easily incorporate new features or change existing ones without affecting the underlying structure of the application. Scalability is achieved by separating components that need to grow independently of others

**Explanation:** 'The microservices architecture is an ideal choice for the Customer Support Ticketing System due to its ability to encapsulate specific functionalities into independent microservices. Each aspect, such as ticket creation, communication channels, and reporting, can be developed and deployed as separate microservices. This approach enhances scalability, flexibility, and fault isolation. It allows for easier updates to individual services without affecting the entire system and supports seamless integration with various communication channels. The microservices architecture ensures that the customer support system is responsive, adaptable, and capable of handling diverse customer interactions.'\n

**Actual Output:**

**Software Architecture Pattern:**  MVC (Model-View-Controller)

**Explanation:** The Model is your data structure. It contains all your tables and their relationships. This is a separate layer from the Controller, which handles application logic. Both of these layers interact with the View, which is the interface that users see. Multiple models can be used in a single application if necessary. Models are generally considered "anti-patterns" when multiple applications share one model because it limits its versatility. Multiple databases are supported by a single model, but this requires a JOIN query. One way to overcome this limitation is to have multiple versions of the same model, called Projections. These projections allow you to store data differently without duplicating the database schema. To accomplish this, use CREATE PROJECTION statements. For example, you could create a projection called Users where the user ID field is placed in addition to the standard User information. Then, another
